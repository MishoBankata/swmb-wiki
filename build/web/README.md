This website is meant to be used as a shorter and more compact version of Wookiepedia.
It can serve as a beginner's guide to Star Wars for new fans.
It features plot revisions for Episodes 1-9, short descriptions of characters,
planets, spaceships and even a little game, made by me.

Here is a working link to the website:
